## 5.3 Notes (Computing Bias)
### What is bias in computing?  

Example 1 (Netlfix):  
   1. Explicit data is aquired by user input (Name, adress, whether you like a show)  
   2. Implicit data is aquired through user actions (What you watch most, type of show, etc.)  
   3. Bias  
      1. Netflix originals are shown to you first so they maintain subscriptions  
      2. Bias based off of implicit and explicit to keep you interested  

Biases can be programmed to reflect trends. This can assist in targetting by age, interests, gender, race, etc.  
Certain in game elements, types of advertisements, etc. can be targetted towards certain groups (COD is more appealing to teenage boys)  
Certain groups want to be diverse (ex: instagram vs facebook)  


Enhancing or excluding?  
Intentionally harming or hurting?  

### Github Pages Action: 
The following questions are based off of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM)  

Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?:  
   No, the owner doesn't think it was intentional  
   
If yes or no, justify you conclusion.:  
   The owner seems to recoginze that it was an oversight in the programming and seemed annoyed but understanding about it happening. 
   
How do you think this happened?:  
   There was a lack of software testing into the camera function and all testing was likely done on exclusivly white people. 
   
Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?:  
   It is harmful due to accessibility issues and an oversight involving racial issues, however it was not intended to cause harm and wasn't intentional  
   
Should it be corrected?:  
   Yes, the developer should update the program through the computer or offer a return on the computer to those having this issue.  
   
What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?:  
   Allow for more extensive testing and crowdsourcing  

## 5.4 Notes (Crowdsourcing)
### How does crowdsourcing extend your reach across the internet?  

Public Data Sets (Kaggle)  
   1. Courses in Visualization
   2. Cash Prizes
   3. Notebooks for code

Google Public Data Sets  
   1. Free for 1Tb
   2. All in one package using BigQuery

Data.gov
   1. US government data
   2. Agriculture, energy, water, health

Crowdsourcing (Spotify) ex:
   1. Collaborative playlists
   2. Algorithm
   3. Metadata write-in
   4. Crowdfunding
      1. Kickstarter
      2. IndieGoGo
   5. Blockchain
      1. crypto
      2. other tokens 
### Github Pages Action: 
1. For our class we could make a class github repo in which code could be share and utilized between students to help with certain aspects of programming. 
2. A crowdsourcing idea would be to create a forum where students could come together and study or work.
