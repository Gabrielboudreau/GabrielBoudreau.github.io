- Digital divide: unequal distribution of access to technology


## **5.5 Questions**

**When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.**

Notes located above

**Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.**

Our team decided to chose Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal due to it's dedication toward the world-wide public domain. For my personal project, I chose the Open Source MIT License because I liked that it allows using code freely and making/distributing closed source versions


## **5.6 Notes**
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Websites maintain a history of what you search
- Used to suggest other websites you may like or for targeted marketing
- Location may be collected
- Risk to Privacy
- Information on the internet is hard to delete

## **5.6 Questions**

**Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.**

PII is Personally Identifiable Information. I have seen PII on projects its CompSci Principles in passwords, names, emails, and phone numbers in the CRUD database. 

**What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?**

I feel that PII is important for identification and personal use, but I feel like it can sometimes be dangerous to have your PII available to other users on the internet. For example, a credit card would be bad PII for the public to see.

**Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.**

Good passwords have uppercase, lowercase, symbol, and number characters. Bad passwords have only one form of characters or have something that identifies you in them; for example, a pet or your mom's name. Another step that is used to assist in authentication is multi factor authentication (using another device to verify your identity) or biometrics.

**Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.**

Symmetric encrytion happens when there's only one key, which is secret, and this key is used to decrypt and encrypt electronic data/information. Asymmetric encryption/cryptography happens when there's a pair of related keys, including one private and one public. These are used to decrypt and encrypt information to protect it from unauthorized use/access. 

**Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.**

In deployment, an example of encryption we used in deployment is SSL, which uses both symmetric and asymmetric encryption. 

**Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.**

A phishing scheme I've learned about the hard way happened when I tried to watch a movie on a poor website. When I clicked on the movie, an "ad" popped up and asked me to download the movie, so I clicked it. Then, malware was downloaded onto my computer. Another phishing technique could be fake websites that steal your credit card information/other PII after you enter it.
