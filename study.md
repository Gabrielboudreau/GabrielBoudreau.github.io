## 5.1 Notes (Benfits and harms) 
### How can a computing innovation be both beneficial and harmful?  
Examples of beneficial and harmful effects:  
Multirotor:

       i. Delivery's  
       ii. Lost person searches  
       iii. photography  
  2. Harmful:

### How can a computer innovation have an impact beyond it's intended purpose?  
Dopamine feedback loops on the internet:  
   1. Reliance on internet for dopamine  
   2. Can have harmful effects that are unintended
      3. Sleep deprivation
      2. depression  
      1. etc.  

Paywalls/in-app-purchases:  
   1. Often on "Free" Games/app's
   2. Special Currencys that convert directly to money that can only be used in game.
   3. Loot boxes are similar to gambling

### Github Pages Action:  
Beneficial effects of computing: 
   1. Potential world wide access to internet. Connectivity between people all across the world
   2. Storing of information, libraries containing tons of information can be stored and accessed whenever neccesary
   3. Online buisness allowing for diversity in companies and many companies to rise to current position. 

Harmful Effects of computing: 
   1. Malware and stealing of personal information, privacy issues. 
   2. Addictive, "dopamine feedback loops", constant desire to check phone/computer
   3. Digital divide, lack of opportunities and struggles to succeed in a "new world"

## 5.2 Notes (Digital Divide)  
### What is the digital divide?  
Reasons why you may not have access to the internet:
   1. Socioeconomic
   2. Geographic
   3. Age
   4. Religion

In some countries the internet is regulated to citizens so it is not used against government  

How can this issue be solved?:  
   1. One way to help solve this issue to try to allow access to all people who want to access it, and keep a level playing field

### Github Pages Action:  
How does someone empower themselves in a digital world?  
   1. They need access to a digital world and the opportunities to learn how to use and connect to their devices freely so they are prepared for a current and upcoming digital age

How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS:  
   1. Del Norte supplies chrome books to all students who check them out in the library with their student ID allowing internet access and access of internet resources to be equal amongst students. I personally could help students learn how to use different aspects of their chrome books after checking them out in order to fix or assist with any accessibility of functionality issues. 

Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?  
   1. No, allowing accessibility and choice in work styles and tools allows for individual learning to be easy for students as they can use what works best for them. Many classes do not offer this option and you are required to use paper for note taking. This is definitely an issue that occurs practically everywhere due to preferences of teachers taking priority over students.
