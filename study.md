# College Board AP Test Prep Notes:

## 5.1 Notes (Benfits and harms) 
### How can a computing innovation be both beneficial and harmful?  
Examples of beneficial and harmful effects:  
Multirotor:  
  1. Benfits:  
       i. Delivery's  
       ii. Lost person searches  
       iii. photography  
  2. Harmful:  
       i. Flying in unregulated zones  
       ii. Privacy concerns  

### How can a computer innovation have an impact beyond it's intended purpose?  
Dopamine feedback loops on the internet:  
   1. Reliance on internet for dopamine  
   2. Can have harmful effects that are unintended
      3. Sleep deprivation
      2. depression  
      1. etc.  

Paywalls/in-app-purchases:  
   1. Often on "Free" Games/app's
   2. Special Currencys that convert directly to money that can only be used in game.
   3. Loot boxes are similar to gambling

### Github Pages Action:  
Beneficial effects of computing: 
   1. Potential world wide access to internet. Connectivity between people all across the world
   2. Storing of information, libraries containing tons of information can be stored and accessed whenever neccesary
   3. Online buisness allowing for diversity in companies and many companies to rise to current position. 

Harmful Effects of computing: 
   1. Malware and stealing of personal information, privacy issues. 
   2. Addictive, "dopamine feedback loops", constant desire to check phone/computer
   3. Digital divide, lack of opportunities and struggles to succeed in a "new world"

## 5.2 Notes (Digital Divide)  
### What is the digital divide?  
Reasons why you may not have access to the internet:
   1. Socioeconomic
   2. Geographic
   3. Age
   4. Religion

In some countries the internet is regulated to citizens so it is not used against government  

How can this issue be solved?:  
   1. One way to help solve this issue to try to allow access to all people who want to access it, and keep a level playing field

### Github Pages Action:  
How does someone empower themselves in a digital world?  
   1. They need access to a digital world and the opportunities to learn how to use and connect to their devices freely so they are prepared for a current and upcoming digital age

How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS:  
   1. Del Norte supplies chrome books to all students who check them out in the library with their student ID allowing internet access and access of internet resources to be equal amongst students. I personally could help students learn how to use different aspects of their chrome books after checking them out in order to fix or assist with any accessibility of functionality issues. 

Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?  
   1. No, allowing accessibility and choice in work styles and tools allows for individual learning to be easy for students as they can use what works best for them. Many classes do not offer this option and you are required to use paper for note taking. This is definitely an issue that occurs practically everywhere due to preferences of teachers taking priority over students. 

## 5.3 Notes (Computing Bias)
### What is bias in computing?  

Example 1 (Netlfix):  
   1. Explicit data is aquired by user input (Name, adress, whether you like a show)  
   2. Implicit data is aquired through user actions (What you watch most, type of show, etc.)  
   3. Bias  
      1. Netflix originals are shown to you first so they maintain subscriptions  
      2. Bias based off of implicit and explicit to keep you interested  

Biases can be programmed to reflect trends. This can assist in targetting by age, interests, gender, race, etc.  
Certain in game elements, types of advertisements, etc. can be targetted towards certain groups (COD is more appealing to teenage boys)  
Certain groups want to be diverse (ex: instagram vs facebook)  


Enhancing or excluding?  
Intentionally harming or hurting?  

### Github Pages Action: 
The following questions are based off of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM)  

Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?:  
   No, the owner doesn't think it was intentional  
   
If yes or no, justify you conclusion.:  
   The owner seems to recoginze that it was an oversight in the programming and seemed annoyed but understanding about it happening. 
   
How do you think this happened?:  
   There was a lack of software testing into the camera function and all testing was likely done on exclusivly white people. 
   
Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?:  
   It is harmful due to accessibility issues and an oversight involving racial issues, however it was not intended to cause harm and wasn't intentional  
   
Should it be corrected?:  
   Yes, the developer should update the program through the computer or offer a return on the computer to those having this issue.  
   
What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?:  
   Allow for more extensive testing and crowdsourcing  

## 5.4 Notes (Crowdsourcing)
### How does crowdsourcing extend your reach across the internet?  

Public Data Sets (Kaggle)  
   1. Courses in Visualization
   2. Cash Prizes
   3. Notebooks for code

Google Public Data Sets  
   1. Free for 1Tb
   2. All in one package using BigQuery

Data.gov
   1. US government data
   2. Agriculture, energy, water, health

Crowdsourcing (Spotify) ex:
   1. Collaborative playlists
   2. Algorithm
   3. Metadata write-in
   4. Crowdfunding
      1. Kickstarter
      2. IndieGoGo
   5. Blockchain
      1. crypto
      2. other tokens 
### Github Pages Action: 
1. For our class we could make a class github repo in which code could be share and utilized between students to help with certain aspects of programming. 
2. A crowdsourcing idea would be to create a forum where students could come together and study or work.

## **5.5 Notes**
- Legal and ethical concerns
- Intellectual property (IP)
- A work of invention that is the result of creativity to which one has rights
- Copyright
- Protects your IP and keeps anyone from using it, unless you give them your permission
- Plagarism: presenting material as your own
- Legal ways to use something not your own:
- Creative Commons
- Provides free licenses that you can use to tell others how to use your creation
- Clearly tells others what they can/cannot do with your IP
- Open source
- Programs made freely available for anyone to use and may be redistributed and modified 
- Open access
- Online research output free of any and all restrictions on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions
- Digital divide: unequal distribution of access to technology


## **5.4 Questions**

**When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.**

Notes located above

**Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.**

Our team decided to chose Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal due to it's dedication toward the world-wide public domain. For my personal project, I chose the Open Source MIT License because I liked that it allows using code freely and making/distributing closed source versions


## **5.6 Notes**
- Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Websites maintain a history of what you search
- Used to suggest other websites you may like or for targeted marketing
- Location may be collected
- Risk to Privacy
- Information on the internet is hard to delete

## **5.6 Questions**

**Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.**

PII is Personally Identifiable Information. I have seen PII on projects its CompSci Principles in passwords, names, emails, and phone numbers in the CRUD database. 

**What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?**

I feel that PII is important for identification and personal use, but I feel like it can sometimes be dangerous to have your PII available to other users on the internet. For example, a credit card would be bad PII for the public to see.

**Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.**

Good passwords have uppercase, lowercase, symbol, and number characters. Bad passwords have only one form of characters or have something that identifies you in them; for example, a pet or your mom's name. Another step that is used to assist in authentication is multi factor authentication (using another device to verify your identity) or biometrics.

**Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.**

Symmetric encrytion happens when there's only one key, which is secret, and this key is used to decrypt and encrypt electronic data/information. Asymmetric encryption/cryptography happens when there's a pair of related keys, including one private and one public. These are used to decrypt and encrypt information to protect it from unauthorized use/access. 

**Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.**

In deployment, an example of encryption we used in deployment is SSL, which uses both symmetric and asymmetric encryption. 

**Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.**

A phishing scheme I've learned about the hard way happened when I tried to watch a movie on a poor website. When I clicked on the movie, an "ad" popped up and asked me to download the movie, so I clicked it. Then, malware was downloaded onto my computer. Another phishing technique could be fake websites that steal your credit card information/other PII after you enter it.
